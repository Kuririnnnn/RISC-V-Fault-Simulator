# RISC-V-Fault-Simulator
## Introduction
Fault simulation is crucial for evaluating processor reliability by injecting faults and analysing their impact. This helps in designing more robust processors that can tolerate manufacturing defects and operational failures.​
## Key Features
*Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor Design – Implements a basic single-cycle datapath at the RTL level.
*Integrated Fault Simulation – Supports injection of stuck-at and delay faults directly in the processor modules.
*Golden vs. Faulty Comparison – Simultaneous execution of fault-free and faulty processors for mismatch detection.
*RTL-Level Validation – Functionality verified through SystemVerilog testbenches and simulation waveforms.
